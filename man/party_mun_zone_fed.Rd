\usage{
party_mun_zone_fed(year, uf = "all", br_archive = FALSE,

\item{uf}{Filter results by Federation Unit acronym (\code{character vector}).}

\item{ascii}{(\code{logical}). Should the text be transformed from Latin-1 to ASCII format?}

\item{encoding}{Data original encoding (defaults to 'Latin-1'). This can be changed to avoid errors
when \code{ascii = TRUE}.}

\item{export}{(\code{logical}). Should the downloaded data be saved in .dta and .sav in the current directory?}

\description{
\code{party_mun_zone_fed()} downloads and aggregates the data on the polls by parties from the federal elections in Brazil,
disaggregated by cities and electoral zones. The function returns a \code{data.frame} where each observation
corresponds to a city/zone.
}
\details{
If export is set to \code{TRUE}, the downloaded data is saved as .dta and .sav
 files in the current directory.
}
\note{
For the elections prior to 2002, some information can be incomplete. For the 2014 and 2018 elections, more variable are available.
