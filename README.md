`electionsBR` provides a comprehensive set of functions for effortlessly retrieving and cleaning Brazilian electoral data from the Brazilian Superior Electoral Court (TSE) [website](https://dadosabertos.tse.jus.br/). The package allows you to access several datasets on local and federal elections for various positions, including city councilors, mayors, state deputies, federal deputies, governors, and presidents, as well as data on voters' profiles, candidates' social media, and personal financial disclosures. The package also provides an alternative API to download data from the [CEPESP Data](https://cepespdata.io/) project. 


## Installation

`electionsBR` is on CRAN and can be installed with:

``` {.r}
install.packages("electionsBR")
```

`electionsBR` is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/). You can install pre-release versions via:

``` {.r}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("silvadenisson/electionsBR")
```

## How does it work?

To download data from a specific election, simply provide the `year` and `type` arguments in the function call. For instance, to retrieve data on candidates from the 2002 election, use the following code:

``` {.r}
library(electionsBR)
df <- elections_tse(year = 2002, type = "candidate")
```

For some data types in presidential elections, TSE provides results in a single file. To download these data, use the `br_archive` argument as follows:


``` {.r}
df <- elections_tse(year = 2022, type = "vote_mun_zone", br_archive = TRUE)
```

Export Brazilian electoral data to [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) and [SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/spss) formats by setting the `export` optional argument to `TRUE` (the data will be saved in your working directory):


``` {.r}
df <- elections_tse(year = 2002, type = "candidate", export = TRUE)
```

To subset results by Brazilian states, use the `uf` argument. For example, to get data on votes for municipal elections in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) in 2000:

``` {.r}
df <- elections_tse(year = 2000, type = "vote_mun_zone", uf = "RS")
```

For detailed information on the package's functionality and a complete list of functions, see the package vignette.

``` {.r}
library(electionsBR)
df <- elections_cepesp(year = 2018, type = "candidate", position = "President")
```
